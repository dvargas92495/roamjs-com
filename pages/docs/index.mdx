# Extensions

These docs explain all of the available extensions, as well as how to set up and use each one.

## Installation

Use the widget below to specify which RoamJS extensions you'd like to install. Once you've selected all the extensions you're interested in, click the `COPY` button to copy the Roam blocks you'd need. Paste the content anywhere in your Roam DB and click Roam's "Yes, I Know What I'm Doing" button to install!

<CopyCode />

We do not recommend installing **all** the extensions. The widget is meant to simply make selecting the ones you do want easier.

### Manual Installation

You could opt to manually install the scripts instead of using the widget above. The widget simply follows the instructions below.

Each tool is hosted at `https://roamjs.com/[name].js`. To use any given tool, first create a **block** with the text `{{[[roam/js]]}}`. Then add the following code block as a child, replacing `[name]` with the actual name of the script:

```js
var existing = document.getElementById("[name]");
if (!existing) {
  var extension = document.createElement("script");
  extension.src = "https://roamjs.com/[name].js";
  extension.id = "[name]";
  extension.async = false;
  extension.type = "text/javascript";
  document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(extension);
}
```

The code block runs on initial load of your roam database. It adds a script tag to the head of your browser, which loads and runs the extension, providing you with the added functionality.

To install multiple scripts in a single code block, add the following code block instead:

```javascript
const installScript = (name) => {
  var old = document.getElementById(name);
  if (old) {
    old.remove();
  }

  var extension = document.createElement("script");
  extension.src = `https://roamjs.com/${name}.js`;
  extension.id = name;
  extension.async = false;
  extension.type = "text/javascript";
  document.getElementsByTagName("head")[0].appendChild(extension);
};

installScript("[name1]"); // replace with name of extension
installScript("[name2]"); // replace with name of extension
// ...
```

Each extension will support a `[[roam/js/[name]]]` configuration page in your Roam database. This is where you will be able to configure the extension with various options using attributes.
