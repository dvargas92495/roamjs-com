The feature set of this extension is very limited and is still experimental. Use at your own risk. Currently, only the following stylings are supported:
- Bolding (CTRL+b/CMD+b)
- Italics (CTRL+i/CMD+i)

To edit a block in WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get) mode, hold on the **ALT** key while clicking on it. Now you should be able to edit the content just like how it will be when rendered!

While in a block, you could hit **ALT+w** to toggle the block to and from WYSIWYG mode.
