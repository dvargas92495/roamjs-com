Any page with embeds will now respect page filters. 

To create an embed, type `{{embed:((block-uid))}}` into a block. Note, that this is a native Roam feature.

To use a page filter, click the filter icon on the top right of a page. The filters will apply to all embeds on the page. Embed block's original page filters will also apply to it.

Only filters applied after installing the extension will apply to embeds. Any previous filter will need to be reapplied for the script to be aware of it.

This extension currently only supports REMOVE filters on a page. This is because Roam will filter out the full embed, since it's on a block without the tag. Supporting includes has been added to the queue.
