On any given page, there will be a new "Open Markmap" option from the `...` menu on the top right. The option will open a panel on the bottom of the page rendering your page data as a map diagram.

The panel will have three additional buttons on it. The rightmost button could be used to enter and exit full screen. The middle button could be used to refresh the mindmap after editing the page data that you're on. The leftmost button could be used to export the mindmap as a PNG or as a OPML for apps like MindNode.

Shift clicking any node will bring you to that block's page!

For more information on markmap, the tool used to create a mindmap of your Roam data, visit their [docs](https://markmap.js.org/docs#what-is-markmap)!

### Configuration

To hide the tag characters like `#[[]]` or `[[]]` from text in the mindmap, add a block that says `Hide Tags` to the `roam/js/mindmap` page.
