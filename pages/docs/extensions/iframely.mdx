This extension integrates with [iframely](https://iframely.com), a uniform back-end and front-end service for all your app's rich media and URL data. You could generate embed friendly cards [here](https://iframely.com/embed).

To use this extension, type `{{iframely:[url]}}` into a block. Replace `[url]` with the actual url that you are looking to embed into Roam. The iframely extension will generate the embed friendly card and place within Roam!
