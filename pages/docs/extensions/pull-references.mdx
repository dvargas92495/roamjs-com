The script supports the following configuration attributes, to be added in the `[[roam/js/pull-references]]` page:

- `Format` - (Optional) The format that each reference will use when added to the page. Use `${ref}` to specify where you want the text to be replaced by the block reference.
- `Remove Tags` - (Optional) Set to 'True' if you would like to remove the tags from the block references after pulling them to the page.
- `Add TODO` - (Optional) Outputs each reference with a `{{[[TODO]]}} ` prefix. Use this as an alternative to Format if you don't want another reference to TODO that doesn't actually map to a task. 

Here's an example configuration from my personal DB:

![](/images/pull-references.png)

Create a button by typing `{{pull references}}` into a page. Clicking the button adds all the linked references as references on the current page.

This extension is also integrated with [Smart Blocks](https://roamjs.com/extensions/smartblocks)! If you have both this extension and Roam42 installed, there will be a `<%PULLREFERENCES%>` command available. The command will automatically pull the linked references and paste blocks before continuing with the rest of the workflow.

### Moving TODOs

To enable this feature, add the phrase `Move Todos` to a block on the `roam/js/pull-references` page and refresh Roam. On any block with a TODO on a daily notes page, a rightward facing arrow icon will appear on hover. Clicking the icon will allow you to pick a date to "move" the TODO to. After moving, the new block will block alias the original block and the original block will block alias the new block.

The Move TODO Dialog also has the option to `ARCHIVED` the todo instead of `DONE` if you have the [todont extension](https://roamjs.com/docs/extensions/todont) installed. You could archive by default, by adding a child to the `Move Todos` block above that says `archived`.

### Moving Any Tagged Block

To enable this feature, add the phrase `Move Tags` to a block on the `roam/js/pull-references` page andrefresh Roam. On any block with any valid Roam tag (e.g. `#Tag`) on a daily notes page, a rightward facing arrow icon will appear on hover. Clicking the icon will allow you to pick a date to "move" the block to. After moving, the new block will block alias the original block and the original block will block alias the new block.
